# aicon Evaluator

A simple evaluator for evaluating a submission on a given task.

## Usage

Refer to the examples folder for package examples, such as `examples/task` and `examples/submission`. Ensure that you zip the contents of these folders without including the folders themselves.

Once you have the packages, follow these steps:

1. Install the evaluator, task, and submission packages:
```
pip install aicon-evaluator.zip task.zip submission.zip
```

`aicon-evaluator.zip` is a zip file containing the contents of this folder (not including `examples` folder).

2. Run the evaluation:
```
aicon_evaluator
```
